# SOC
This is my SOC github repository. SOC-- real time driver drowsiness.

I have learnt python starting from basic level uptil advanced level. With this, I am very much comfortable with python and would be using it in the project.
I am also familiar with all python functions and modules.

Then I learnt that there are three types of machine learnings -- supervised, unsupervised and reinforcemnet.
This project uses only supervised learning which i learned from course by andrew ng on machine learning. i have, however, also looked into the other types of ML tho not in much detail.
Then, i sharpened the maths required for this project (linear algebra).
With this, I was done with ML and then started with its libraries of numpy, pandas and matplotlib.

Currently, i am doing deep learning.
