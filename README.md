# SOC
This is my SOC github repository. SOC-- real time driver drowsiness.

I have learnt python starting from basic level uptil advanced level. With this, I am very much comfortable with python and would be using it in the project.
I am also familiar with all python functions and modules.

Then I learnt that there are three types of machine learnings -- supervised, unsupervised and reinforcemnet.
This project uses only supervised learning which i learned from course by andrew ng on machine learning. i have, however, also looked into the other types of ML tho not in much detail.
Then, i sharpened the maths required for this project (linear algebra).
With this, I was done with ML and then started with its libraries of numpy, pandas and matplotlib.
Now that i am done with the libraries of python, i move on to learn deep learning. i did crash course and completed deep learning. i then thoroughly studied Convolutional neural network CNN. this completes the theory.

Now i start with tensorflow, keras and openCV module of python. i import them and learn using jupyter notebook. I studied MNIST data set to get a breif idea of the scenario. 

Starting with the coding part..

I import the installed modules and download the dataset of drowsiness from kaggle. Using this and the other CNN functions, i build the model (code of which is attached in the github repo). The model uses mobilenet research paper and downloaded images which gives positive feedback for closed eye and negative for open eye. After i run my model, open eye detected yields a negative output which confirms the working of the model.

Model has an accuracy of over 95 %.
